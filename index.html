    <h2>Bruce Arden</h2>
    <p>Bruce Arden was an electrical engineer who worked<br>at the University of Michigan, and was involved in<br>the creation of the MTS (Michigan Terminal System)<br>and the revolutionary time-sharing operating system.<br><br><br>Arden began his success by building and programming<br>IBM's first computer. With this experience under his<br>belt, he delved into electrical engineering at the<br>University of Rochester and eventually became a<br>professor at the university. Arden exclaimed that<br>computers have evolved faster than he imagined.<br><br><br>"Now, if a computer virus shut down the nation's computers, the whole country would stop. We are that dependent."</p>
